# Test plan and Output

The Image dataset for this project is taken from 3000 randomly chosen images of the Waterloo Exploration Database [1].
Out of these 3000 images, about 90% of images, that is 2700 images were selected for training the neural network and 300 images were choosen for testing our neural network.

These images were tested and the results were compared to the original dataset and we received approximately 91% accuracy.

Output of all the inputs were tested against the Mean Square error loss function with the ground truth image for the comparison. And as mentioned above, we received more than ninety
percent accuracy which can be seen as an accomplishment given how difficult phase retrieval is.
