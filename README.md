# Deep-iterative reconstruction phase retrieval

Developed a DNN-HIO iterative system that retrieves the phase of the image by using the amplitude of the fourier transform of the image
Image reconstruction from a diffraction pattern, as in Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI)
This is an implementation of the iterative Deep Neural Network(DNN) - Hybrid input-output (HIO) algorithm, done in python.
